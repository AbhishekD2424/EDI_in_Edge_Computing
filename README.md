# EDI_in_Edge_Computing
Created a system to check the Effective Data Integrity in Edge Computing using the Botan library in C++. Created a simple UDP connection that allowed checking the integrity of any shared file by generating unique tags based on the theoretical research paper, i.e. the 'Efficient_Verification_of_Edge_Data_Integrity_in_Edge_Computing_Environment.pdf' paper uploaded in the repository.

NOTE: READ THE 'makefile' TO RUN THE PROGRAM.
